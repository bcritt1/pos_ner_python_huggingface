# Huggingface NER Workflow

This repo contains two simple files that execute huggingface's parts of speech and named entity 
[taggers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/task_summary#named-entity-recognition) on a 
directory of 
.txt files.

## File Overview

The files consist of:

1. [huggingface.py](huggingface.py): Runs ntlk on a corpus, outputing a .json file with POS and NER for all the words in your corpus.
2. [huggingface.sbatch](huggingface.sbatch): Creates a batch job for huggingface.py.

## Usage instructions

### Setting up and Connecting to Sherlock

1. Before we log onto Sherlock, let's make sure we're going to have everything we need there and move inputs/corpus onto Sherlock. For info on transferring data to Sherlock, see:
[https://www.sherlock.stanford.edu/docs/storage/data-transfer/](https://www.sherlock.stanford.edu/docs/storage/data-transfer/). [rsync](https://www.sherlock.stanford.edu/docs/storage/data-transfer/#rsync) is probably the best program for
this, but if you prefer another, go with that. For rsync, you'd use the command 
```bash
rsync -a ~/path/to/local/data yourSUNetid@login.sherlock.stanford.edu:/scratch/users/$USER/corpus/
```
You'll need to tweak the local path because I don't know where your files are located, but the remote path (after the ":") should work fine to get your corpus into scratch, a fast storage system where it's best to do file 
reading/writing.

2. Now we can log onto Sherlock using ssh in the Terminal program on Mac[^1]. with the syntax: 
```bash
ssh yourSUNetID@sherlock.stanford.edu
```
### File Management

3. Once we're logged on, we want to put these files on Sherlock:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bcritt1/pos_ner_python_huggingface.git
```
This will create a directory in your home space on Sherlock called "pos_ner_python_huggingface" with all the files in this repository.

4. Let's also make three directories for the outputs of our process:
```bash
mkdir out err /scratch/users/$USER/outputs
```
### Running Code

5. Now, let's move into our new directory
```bash
cd huggingface
```
and submit our sbatch file to slurm, Sherlock's job scheduler: 
```
sbatch huggingface.sbatch
```
You can watch your program run with
```
watch squeue -u $USER
```
When it finishes running, you should see your outputs as .csv and .json files in the outputs/ 
directory on scratch. This data can then be used as an input for other processes, or analyzed on its own.

## Code Explanation

The above walkthrough is designed to be as easy as possible to execute. If it works for you and you don't want to know about the code, you may not need to read this. If you want to know more, or need to tweak something, this section will 
help.

### huggingface.sbatch

A batch script that gives [slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/pdfs/summary.pdf), Sherlock's job scheduler, instructions on how to set up for and run our python code. Everything that starts with a "#" are directives to slurm, and everything 
after are commands we're executing in the terminal on Sherlock.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=huggingface									# gives the job a descriptive name that slurm will use
#SBATCH --output=/home/users/%u/out/huggingface.%j.out						# the filepath slurm will use for output files. I've configured this so it automatically inserts variables for your username (%u) and the job name (%j) above.
#SBATCH --error=/home/users/%u/err/huggingface.%j.err						# the filepath slurm will use for error files. I've configured this so it automatically inserts variables for your username (%u) and the job name (%j) above.
#SBATCH -p hns											# the partition slurm will use for the job. Here it is hns (humanities and sciences), but you can use other partions (sh_part to see which you can access)
#SBATCH -c 1											# number of cores to use. This should be 1 unless you've rewritten the code to run in parallel
#SBATCH --mem=32GB										# memory to use. 32GB should be plenty, but if you're getting a memory error, you can increase
module load python/3.9.0									# load the most recent version of python on Sherlock
pip3 install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers					# download hugging face library
pip3 install --pre torch -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cpu/torch_nightly.html	# download nightly pytorch
python3 huggingface.py										# run the python script
```

### huggingface.py

The python file contains pretty frequent in-line documentation, which you can check out using either ```cat huggingface.py``` or ```nano huggingface.py``` for more detail. As an outline, the script loads language models for huggingface, 
uses them on 
a 
corpus of files that I route it to automatically using environment variables (it reads your username from Sherlock and uses that to find your files) to perform word tokenization, parts of speech tagging, and named entity tagging. Because 
huggingface does all this in one step, there aren't a ton of tweaks to be made. While some more extensive text cleaning is generally desirable in NLP, NER tagging tends to rely to 
some extent on things like capitalization and exact phrases which may be altered by lowercasing or lemmatization, respectively. If you 
have issues, contact [us](mailto:srcc-support@stanford.edu) and ask for Brad Rittenhouse.

 #### Notes

[^1]: The syntax would be the same if you use Terminal on Linux or Windows Subsystem for Linux [(WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Using other programs is possible, but documenting them here would be 
impossible.
